## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

- **Data Source**: Telco Churn Dataset (Kaggle)
- **Tools Used**: SQL Server, Tableau
- **Skills Demonstrated**:
  - Data Cleaning
  - Feature Engineering
  - Churn Rate Analysis
  - Customer Segmentation
  - Cohort Analysis
  - Window Functions (Running Totals)
  - Tableau KPI Dashboard

---

## ðŸ›  Key Tasks

1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**
   - Handling nulls and data type issues
   - Creating clean numeric fields (`CleanTotalCharges`)
   - Churn Flag (`IsChurned`)

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Overall churn rate and tenure statistics
   - Churn by contract type, payment method, senior citizen status

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Monthly revenue
   - Estimated customer LTV
   - Rule-based churn risk segmentation

4. **Advanced Analysis**
   - Running churn rate by tenure (window functions)
   - Cohort churn analysis
   - Churn vs non-churn customer comparison

## ðŸ“Œ Sample Insights

- Customers with month-to-month contracts and fiber internet churn more frequently.
- Short-tenure customers and high monthly charges are early indicators of churn risk.
- Running churn rate decreases as tenure increases â€” retention improves with time.
